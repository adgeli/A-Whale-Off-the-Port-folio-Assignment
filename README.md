The following assignment conducts a financial analysis of portfolios containing various equities representing those of "whale" investors and firms' algorithmic portfolios to visualize and compare performance to that of the S&P 500 market. An assortment of Python and Pandas technqiues are used to perform a quantitative analysis of risk, returns, volatitlity, and sharpe ratios to determine which portfolio returns optimal performance. 

Additionally, the same metrics are applied to develop and analyze a custom portfolio. The purpose of the personal portfolio is to compare its results to those in part one of the assignment and assess the equities returns.

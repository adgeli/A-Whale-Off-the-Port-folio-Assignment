An assortment of Python and Pandas technqiues are used to perform a quantitative analysis of risk, returns, volatitlity, and sharpe ratios to determine which portfolio returns optimal performance. 

Additionally, the same metrics are applied to develop and analyze a custom portfolio. The purpose of the personal portfolio is to compare its results to those in part one of the assignment and assess the equities returns.
